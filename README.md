- This project is focusing on an eBook Library -- an online platform that breaks the restrictions of the library on simultaneous use and provides online lending services of a wide variety of digital books for readers, especially for the library users who are unhappy with all the time and economic cost of physically presenting at the library to borrow or return the print books.
